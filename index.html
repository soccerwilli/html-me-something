    <p>In 2007 I co-founded Piasa FC along with my father, Jim Williams;
        my business partner, Arsenio Gudino; and two long-time soccer associates,
         Dr. Matin Royeen and Gilberto Restrepo, as an amateur team to compete
         in the Premier Arena Soccer League.</p>

    <p>In 2010, at the PASL commissioner’s behest, we were in a position to take
         the team to the professional ranks in the Professional Arena Soccer League
         that had been founded in 2008. The team was rebranded ‘Illinois Piasa’
         and the rest was history.</p>

    <p>There were good times and bad, ups and downs. I met great people and have
         some really good memories, despite very limited success on the field
         for the team.</p>

    <p>By April 2014, the arduous journey was at an end. The same week I sold
        my team for 'next-to-nothing', my girlfriend of three years and
        soon-to-be-fiance, left me. My world was coming apart and I needed a plan.</p>

    <p>After a ton of thought and discussion with family and friends, it seemed
        the solution was to pursue a degree that would catapult me into the world
        of computer programming. I have since taken classes at Southwestern Illinois
        College and Red Rocks Community College – Denver, CO, but when the opportunity
        presented itself to enroll in LC 101, I felt it was too good an opportunity to pass up.</p>
